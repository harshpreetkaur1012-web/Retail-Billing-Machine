# 🧾 Retail Billing System (Python Tkinter)

A **desktop-based Retail Billing System** developed using **Python and Tkinter**, designed to automate the billing process in small retail shops.  
The application allows users to generate bills, calculate item-wise prices, apply taxes, save bills, print bills, and send invoices via email.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a **real-world desktop application** using Python.  
It focuses on **GUI development, event-driven programming, file handling, and user interaction**, which are essential skills for software development internships.
